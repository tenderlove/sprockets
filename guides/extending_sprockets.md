# Extending Sprockets

Sprockets can use custom processors, compressors, and directives. This document is intended for library authors who want to extend sprockets functionality.

## WIP

This guide is a work in progress. There are many different groups of people who interact with sprockets. Some only need to know directive syntax to put in their asset files, some are building features like the Rails asset pipeline, and some are plugging into sprockets and writing things like preprocessors. The goal of these guides are to provide task specific guidance to make the expected behavior explicit. If you are using sprockets and you find missing information in these guides, please consider submitting a pull request with updated information.

These guides live in [guides](/guides).
